				<strong>Personal Background:</strong>
					 I grew up and always lived in Illinois, and moved to Concord, NC in May of 2019. In 2020 I moved to Belmont, NC and still live here.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Professional Background:</strong>
					 I currently work at Amazon and have for nearly two years (two year mark will be in September of 2021.) I am hoping to be accepted into the Amazon Technical Academy and I am working very hard to be accepted, but it’s extremely difficult and the odds are very much against me. But I’m trying and hoping for the best!
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Academic Background:</strong>
					 I graduated high school in 2016 from Warrensburg-Latham High School, and started that fall at Parkland College. I only finished my freshman year there and my life fell apart so I dropped out. I moved 12 hours away and started at CPCC in Fall of 2019. I figured if I moved far away from the excuses I was making to keep myself from going back to school I’d have to go back, and it’s working!

        <strong>Background in this subject:</strong>
           In high school I did dual credit classes through the Heartland Technical Academy, which is through Richland Community College. That’s when I started messing around with Raspberry Pi’s and decided at least to a point that coding was exciting, even though it irritated me, but I loved being able to problem solve and figure out what I was doing wrong. I’m working on an associate degree in Full Stack Programming currently at CPCC, and hope to be finished in May of 2022!
      </li>
			<li>
				<strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>
					Asus VivoBook running Windows (this is seriously my favorite laptop I’ve ever had, I love it) and I also have a Macbook Pro but I’m more of a Windows person so I don’t do much with it.
			</li>

				<strong>Courses I'm taking and why: 
					<ol>
						<li>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting - Required for my degree, although after taking WEB110 twice, the second time I did with D.I. von Briesen and I actually passed because he made everything make sense! So this time I definitely made sure to look if he was offering WEB115. </strong><a href="contract.html"> Contract </a>
            </li>
						<li>CSC151 - JAVA Programming - Required for my degree (now) I was supposed to take CSC143 I believe, but it’s no longer offered and this was the replacement I was told to take.
            </li>
						<li>CSC121 - Python Programming - Required for my degree, although I am also retaking this class again. In the spring I moved home to Illinois for 3+ months to take care of my grandmother who passed during the summer semester. Between helping her and her actual passing, my grades dropped and I failed a couple classes or barely passed, but my GPA is now screaming.
            </li>
						<li>CIS115 - Intro to Program and Logic - Required for my degree, also retaking this class. I just wanted to be considered full time and I have no other options because everything else I need is in the spring semester, so I figured I’d help bring my GPA up a tiny bit by retaking this class.
            </li>
					</ol>
					</ul>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Funny/Interesting item about myself:</strong>
					I have 23 piercings and 5 tattoos, I’d have more if I wasn’t a wage slave to Jeff Bezos and wasn’t a broke college student.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>I'd also like to share:</strong>
					 I’m 12 hours from home with basically no friends and literally no family. I am always stressed and overwhelmed, so I am a huge mess at all times.
